                <p class="contact">
                    For Fuse.AR I worked on various Instagram filters that were commissioned by different companies
                    who wanted to have AR filters to advertise their product. Specifically I worked on making sure 
                    that the filters had some kind of game element to them so that the user would enjoy playing them.
                    I worked there from May 1st, 2022 until August 25th, 2022.

                <p class="contact">
                    At iD Tech Camps I worked as a summer camp instructor and taught campers about game and level design through out 
                    the week. I would also help them use the game and level design skills I taught them to create different levels in
                    Minecraft that the could show off and play with their friends at the end of the week. I worked at iD Tech Camps during 
                    the summers of 2019, 2020, and 2021.
