                This was the first game that I developed as part of the MI 445 Game Design Minor class, where you play as an
                average day retail worker employed at MoMart who is secretly a monster just trying to get by. For this game I 
                designed and created the MoMart store and layout that the player is in. I really wanted to make sure that the 
                level gave the player the feeling that they were walking around a retail store, however I didn't want the player 
                to feel bored by this either. As a result I designed the layout of the store to be able to have a variety of 
                different aisles with different items, as well as make sure the player wasn't only walking in a straight line to 
                and from the objectives as that is not a fun experience. One other thing we created to make sure MoMart did not become
                monotoneus were NPC customers, each with their own minigame they let you play. Everyone helped with the process of making
                sure they felt fun and enjoyable which resulted in good breaks between the different tasks.

                This is the second game that I am currently developing for my MI 445 class. In Pizzakei, the player plays as a man 
                who has recently passed away but has been reincarnated as a sentient pizza mobster sent on a quest to take down the 
                H.U.T. crime family. It is a 2D Metroidvania shooter game. My contributions to the game so far has been setting up 
                the animations, creaating the sounds, and the biggest contribution has been the level design which can be seen in the 
                two pictures above. My thought process for the levels were to make them fun to explore and move around as I knew the player
                was going to be moving between the different areas often. I also wanted to make sure that the combat was fun which is why
                I was very careful in how I placed the enemies.
